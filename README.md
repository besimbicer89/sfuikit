# sfuikit
A UI kit for Satisfactory mods
-----------
This is currently very much a WIP. While the PSD is ready to go in its current state, the information provided here is incomplete.
-----------

This is a 'build your own' UI kit.

It's all vector-based, so you will likely need photoshop as that's what it was made in. Other applications may support this kit, but they are outside of the scope of technical help with this kit.

To use this kit, it is assumed that you can use photoshop, and can perform basic vector editing tasks. If not; There are many tutorials on youtube.

You will also need game assets to complete your UI, which cannot be provided here for copyright reasons. You can export them from the game yourself with a tool like https://www.gildor.org/en/projects/umodel. Guidance for doing so can be found at the link.

You will also need two fonts:
Segoe UI (part of standard windows fonts)
Orbitron - https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/orbitron

The kit is currently just a reproduction of standard in-game UI assets, and will be expanded over time.

>>Contents:
Single PSD.
PSD contains the following elements:

Button frame
Text box
Bolt
Colour swatch
Font examples
6 Background panels

This pack is created and maintained by discord user Deantendo#4265 and can be contacted via the satisfactory modding channel's sub-channel; Art.
Contributions to this pack are welcome, though final acceptance and edits will be at the discretion of the pack maintainer for the time being or at such time as the pack is presented in a more open format.

CORNER SIZES
	outer: 5px
	Inner: 3px

Fonts:
	Segoe UI / Semi bold / 13.7pt for most things.
	See text examples file for the full list.

Colours:
	List hex and RGB values here

Specifically relating to GIMP:
Most of the SFUI kit will open in GIMP, but text layers will probably not work.
To improve compatibility of PSD files for GIMP users it is recommended to avoid using folder grouping.
GIMP users will have to delete text layers and re-make them as needed.

File formats:
Files must be submitted in the following formats only:
	PSD
	PNG
	JPG (only if transparancy is not required)

Design guidelines:
	Largely the idea is to follow in-game assets.
	Do not include texture overlays.
	Do not include copyright material
	Do not include game assets
	You must include attribution links
	Files are per item. No collections.
	Designs must be of a high-standard, and closely match the quality of existing assets
	Any text baked into files must be in English.
	The right to reject, edit, or reqest modifications to submissions is retained.
	Submitted items or changes will be thoroughly examined against the above guidelines.


Future project goals:
	To make the project more open to submissions from approved contributors
	To split the current initial file set into per-item files.
	To explore compatibility between PS, GIMP, and perhaps other options.
	To tidy the initial repo
	To write a more in-depth guide
	To source links to suitable PS tutorials.
	To create some simple templates so that creators of smaller mods can 'self-serve'
	To create a system through which modders can request UI work for their mods.
